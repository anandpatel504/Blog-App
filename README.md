# Blog-App

#### I have created a blog app in which the user can register and login and after that, he can post and view the blogs. and also he can like and dislike. For this app, I used Express, Mysql, Knex, and JWT for authentication:

      -Register using email & password ( use JWT for authentication )
      -Login
      -Create a post
      -See all posts from other users on home page
      -Like/Dislike a post
      -see how many likes/dislikes a post have in realtime
      
## Required technologies:

      -NodeJS
      -JWT
      -Knex
      -Body-Parser
      -Mysql
